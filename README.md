# Website Redesign / UI-UX Case Study: Anita Dongre – Luxury Ethnic & Bridal Fashion
## Project Summary

This project is a full UI/UX redesign and concept overhaul for the Anita Dongre e-commerce website, focusing on its identity as a luxury wedding and ethnic fashion brand. The redesign aims to reflect the brand’s deep roots in Indian craftsmanship, heritage textiles, and sustainable fashion while elevating the online shopping experience for global customers.

## Brand Essence & Story

- Craftsmanship & Heritage: Anita Dongre’s designs are deeply inspired by India’s rich artisanal traditions — from Pichhwai hand-painting to Ajrakh and Banarasi weaves. 
- Sustainability Commitment: The brand is dedicated to ethical fashion, working with artisan communities, paying fair wages, and preserving traditional crafts. 
- Global Reach, Local Roots: From its origins in India to flagship stores in cities like Beverly Hills, the brand has successfully married local art with international sensibility. 

## Design Goals & Objectives

### 1.	Highlight Key Collections
- Spotlight bridal wear, pre-draped sarees, and seasonal couture lines. Create clear navigation for bridal, groom, and occasion wear.
### 2.	Celebrate Artisanal Craft
-	Use storytelling to showcase craftsmanship (like Pichhwai murals, hand embroidery, SEWA collaborations). 
-	Feature “Sustaining Crafts” section prominently, reinforcing the brand’s social impact. 
### 3.	Premium & Immersive UX
-	Elegant UI with high-resolution imagery, refined typography, and a soft color palette.
-	Seamless flows for browsing, wishlist, appointment booking, and checkout — tailored for high-ticket, designer items.
### 4.	Multi-Regional Experience
-	Localized storefronts (India, U.S., UAE) with region-specific currency and shipping. 
-	Mobile-first design to ensure rich experience across all devices.
### 5.	Sustainability & Story-Driven Content
-	Pages dedicated to the designer’s mission, the Anita Dongre Foundation, and her collaborations. 
-	Blog / “In The Press” integration for brand storytelling and thought leadership.
